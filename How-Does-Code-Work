The code is an implementation for an MDP.
Which means we will have states, actions, cost/reward- and probability functions.

Since this is a model for hospital admissions, we will work with states of how many people are in each hospital specialty at each period in time. 
The actions will represent how many people will be added to what treatment pattern for each hospital specialty in the next time period.

The action will have no influence whatsoever on the transition of a patient from one treatment pattern to another.
It will only affect the effective admission into a specialty of the hospital, and not even the specific treatment pattern.

Something that does take care of that is the transition probability.

So what will we effectively input into our program?
-We will need to know what the maximum ADMISSION capacity per specialty is
-We need to ask for the available capacity per period
-The average resource utilization per treatment pattern

What should we consider doing for the classes?
-A parent class of specialties, from which each specialty will inherit.
